# Dev Requirements
Before contributing changes, make sure your dev environment is configured to automatically lint your files.
You will need to do the following:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
```
This should now set up:
- black
- autopep8
- pre-commit
- flake8
- isort
